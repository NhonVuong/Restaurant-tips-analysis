# Restaurant-tips-analysis
##### 1. Project Title
Restaurant tips analysis
##### 2. A brief description of what your project does
This project analyzes restaurant tipping behavior using a dataset containing information such as total bill, tip amount, customer gender, smoking status, day, time, and party size. The goal is to uncover insights and patterns in tipping habitsâ€”such as whether gender influences tipping, how tip amounts relate to total bills, and how other factors like smoking or time of day affect tips. The project includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualizations, and statistical testing to support data-driven conclusions.

###### Source of the Data:
The dataset was collected independently and saved as a CSV file [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv)

###### Description of the Dataset:
The dataset includes records of dining transactions, capturing details about the bill, tip amount, customer demographics, and other context-related information.

###### How to Access the Data:
```
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
df = pd.read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv")
```

##### 4. The main goals
Analyze tipping behavior based on customer gender to identify any patterns or differences.

Explore relationships between tip amount and other variables such as total bill, day, sex, time, size using visualizations and statistics.

Generate insights that can help understand customer behavior in a restaurant setting.

Practice data analysis skills using Python, specifically with the pandas and matplotlib libraries for data handling and visualization.

##### 5. Results
###### Tip Amount by Gender (sex)
Male customers tipped an average of ~$3.09

Female customers tipped an average of ~$2.83

-> Men tend to tip slightly more than women in absolute value.
